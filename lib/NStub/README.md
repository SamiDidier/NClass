NStub
=====
NStub? What's NStub? NStub is a unit test generator for .NET assemblies. You simply point NStub at the assembly containing the types you wish to test, pick the types and methods that your interested in from interface, choose where you want the resulting source files to be created at, and click GO!. That's all there is to it!

What do I get? Your resulting group of source files will contain one stubbed test method for each method that you selected. The code is clean, clearly documented and is already decorated to work with your chosen test framework. All you have to do is fill in the logic. Each group of source files even comes with an associated project allowing you to quickly open the files in Visual Studio and start editing. Not using Visual Studio? No problem! Just open the files individually in your chosen development environment and go to work.

That sounds great...except for... NStub is fully extensible, allowing you to create plug-ins not only to support multiple testing frameworks but also to generate the testing code in any .NET compliant language. The sky is the limit to what you can accomplish.

There a few driving principles behind NStub, we consider these our 'bill of rights' so to speak and hold them in highest regarding when making all design and development decisions. No matter what functionality is added to NStub, you can always rest assured that none of these inalienable rights will ever be violated.

* All projects will compile immediately after generation
* NStub will not 'lock you into' any particular testing framework or language
* There will be no aspect of NStub that you can't extend, alter, or modify to suit your own purposes

This sounds like something I could use! Great, then give it a shot! Just download our current stable build and let us know what you think. Have a suggestion or want to help out? Even better! Just drop us a line and we'll be happy to listen to what you have to say!
